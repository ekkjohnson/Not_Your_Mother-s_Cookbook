  # Description
 Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

Do you struggle to decide what to cook or remember your best meal ideas? You could use a cookbook, like the one sitting in your mom's kitchen cabinet, but those are old and outdated. You need something to keep up with you and your busy life in the modern world. An online cookbook. A place to add your recipes, your way. 

Not Your Mother's Cookbook is just that. It is an online cookbook you can log in to and save your old favorites or newly discovered recipes. Just type the recipe in and, boom! Ready to go for easy future use. 

Simple, modern, and easy to use. It's better than your mother's, trust us. 

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Our motivation for development was to have an easy to access cookbook. In the modern world, no one wants to use cookbooks anymore. If you want to make something you would search the recipe online. But then, how would you save it? So we created "Not Your Mother's Cookbook" as an online cookbook you can tailor to recipes you want to add and save for future use. 

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Technologies we used included handlebars, javascript, html, css, bootstrap, animate css, google fonts, sql, sequelize, and heroku.

Roles were broken down as follows:

Bret:

Carolyn:

Elizabeth: Project Manager, recipe handlebars, recipe page layout, CSS styling, CSS animation, writing up ReadMe, pitch writer.

Challanges we faced included working with passport and eventually giving up due to time constraints, file captilization issues with github, and the usual pull issues with github, but was better than project 1. 

Successes we had included working and collaborating well as a team, staying on track with class pacing, and deploying app. 

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for Future Development

Directions for the future would be to sort the user input recipe cards alphabetically and adding a search function. Another idea would be to link pinterest for an easy to save function for recipe ideas.
